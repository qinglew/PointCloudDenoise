# Point Cloud Denoise

Some general filtering algorithms of point cloud implemented by [PCL](https://github.com/PointCloudLibrary/pcl). Simple interfaces are given.

## Filtering Algorithms

* Passthrough Filter
* Voxelization Filter
* Statistical Outliers Removal
* Radius Outliers Removal

Also, we implement the interface for I/O and visualization. Please make a preparation for the configuration of PCL before uisng.
